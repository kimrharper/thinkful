Typically one version is a \"control version,\" often already in use (or \"no intervention\"), and one is a \"test version,\" which has some changes from the control. That change is often called the treatment. If starting from scratch, however, you may have two different test versions to compare to each other.\n",
    "<li>A sample, divided into two groups. Each sample should be selected so that it is similar to the population you want to understand. The groups should be similar to one another so that any differences between them can be attributed to seeing version A or version B and not something else. You also want the split of between A and B to be as random as possible.\n",

    "<li>Outcome(s) of interest. What you expect will change as a result of using version A or version B, and how you will measure that change. This means you have to decide on a key metric, which should capture the effect of your change and reflect the motivations for the test in the first place.\n",
    "<li>Other measured variables. This includes information about the two groups that can be used to ensure they are similar, as well as secondary outcomes that are less important than the primary outcomes of interest but which might also change in response to using version A or version B."
