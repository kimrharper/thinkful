      "often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \t0\n",

      "it was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \n",
      "too politically correct.  \n",
      "very disappointing.  \n",

      "technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  \n",
      "it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  \n",
      "the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  \n",

      "this movie is also revealing.  \n",
      "personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  \n",
      "and it was boring.  \n",
      "i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  \n",

      "the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the \"acting coach\" are fascinating.  \n",

      "i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973, when it was \"the stranger\" and i loved it.  \n",
      "but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr.  \n",
      "this movie is so awesome!  \n",
      "i loved it, it was really scary.  \n",

      "this is an extraordinary film.  \n",
      "as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening.  \n",
      "this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  \n",
      "the film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen.  \n",
      "this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole.  \n",

      "it is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd.  \n",
      "how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's all wrong.  \n",
      "in fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  \n",
      "avoid at all costs!  \n",
      "star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series.  \n",
      "the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  \n",
      "the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \n",
      "the only place good for this film is in the garbage.  \n",
      "the worst one of the series.  \n",
      "editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  \n",
      "when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song old man by neil young was played, which evokes many emotions.  \n",
      "cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way.  \n",
      "of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  \n",
      "this film offers many delights and surprises.  \n",
      "when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from \"don giovanni\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  \n",
      "the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  \n",
      "you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  \n",

      "the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  \n",

      "the acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  \n",

      "it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  \n",
      "the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  \n",
      "plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  \n",

      "feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal.  \n",
      "very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist.  \n",
      "it's very slow.  \n",
      "lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  \n",

      "the acting is beyond abysmal.  \t0\n",
      "everything stinks.  \t0\n",
      "trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  \t0\n",
      "worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  \t0\n",

      "if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  \t1\n",
      "the result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  \t1\n",
      "a film not easily forgotten.  \t1\n",
      "but, kevin spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  \t1\n",
      "the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  \t1\n",
      "the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  \t1\n",

      "great movie!  \t1\n",
      "also the story and acting were weak.  \t0\n",
      "at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  \t0\n",

      "the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie.  \n",
      "kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"at play in the fields of the lord\".  \n",

      "it's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \n",
      "it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \n",
      "just whatever you do, avoid \"groove\" as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic.  \n",
