    "__Summary:__\n",
    "> In my previous profession, I have been teaching English to a diverse range of students of all ages, language background, and country origin. During my professional development, I started to observe that different students with different L1s (1st Language) tended to display different patterns of communication that appeared to have some connection to either education in their country of origin or a connection to the linguistic structure of their first language. Different ELL (English Language Learners) needed to focus on different aspects of the English language depending on their background. The purpose of this project is to use a large number of blog posts from a language practicing website and explore whether or not the L1 has any significant impact on the blog writing style of the English learner.<br><br>Part 1: Explore the data to find any noteworthy trends in linguistic structure: <ol><li> vocabulary (word freq, collocations, and cognates) <li>syntax (sentence structure)<li>grammar (i.e. grammar complexity of sentences) <li>errors (types of errors) <li> parts of speech (NLTK Abbreviations: https://pythonprogramming.net/natural-language-toolkit-nltk-part-speech-tagging/)</ol><br>Part 2: Use linguistic trends to determine whether or not a learner's first language can be predicted."
