      "2 \"Where are your bow and arrows, my little man?\"\n",
      "3 Do you know he has found a  treasure, he says, in his father's garden a vase full of gold?\n",
      "4 \"Then,\" said Archer, \"stand out in the right and  be free.\"\n",
      "5 Ask Tom.\"\n",
      "6 said  he, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his money.\n",
      "7 \"Thank you,\" said Mr Butler, K.C., and sat down suddenly, as if he had got what he wanted.\n",
      "8 His friend, Flambeau, a semi-official investigator, was sitting opposite him, making his last notes of a case he had cleared up in the neighbourhood.\n",
      "9 He was also refreshingly lucid, as he was on the committees.\n",
      "10 They hesitate between new motives and old principles.\n",
      "11 Oh, Paul, you forgot.\n",
      "12 Miss Etta Todd is one of our deep-souled New Yorkers, and comes into an income of nearly twelve hundred million dollars.\"\n",
      "13 \"Behind the lectern, and looking across the valley, stood a very old man in a black robe that fell as straight as the cliffs around him, but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike to waver in the wind.\n",
      "14 I thought your worship  would excuse I'm quite, as it were, rejoiced to see your worship look so  purely, and to find you up so hearty     Just.\n",
      "15 Nor did he watch long in vain.\n",
      "16 \"Because,\" said Carlo, laughing again at the recollection, \"you held your  pencil so drolly; and when you were to cut it, you cut it just as if you  were using a pruning-knife to your vines; but now it is your turn to  laugh, for you surpass us all.\n",
      "17 But granted his harmless qualities doesn't that banker strike you as a splendid instance of my argument?\n",
      "18 Hence he has a wound inside him, which I am sure (from the expression on his face) is not a serious one.\n",
      "19 Louisa opened her eyes.\n",
      "20 But to think of hate so patient \"       \"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "21 \"Always some little thing to be done,\" he said with idiotic cheerfulness; \"as George Herbert says:  `Who sweeps an Admiral's garden in Cornwall as for Thy laws makes that and the action fine.'\n",
      "22 There was certainly too much of it in the air.\n",
      "23 The bees swarmed about her.\n",
      "24 exclaimed Father Brown, \"and how much more sentimental must American men of science be!\n",
      "25 I think that will be the best plan.'\n",
      "26 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on.\n",
      "27 He built a new house  at the entrance of the village, and had a large, well fenced garden, yet,  notwithstanding his fences, he never felt himself secure.\n",
      "28 Set in dreamy and exquisite scenery, and moving in mystical dances, the green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the elusive individuality of an elfin queen.\n",
      "29 Time was he'd have come  down for me before ever so many fine folks, and have eat his crumbs out  of my hand, at my first call; but, poor fellow!\n"
